# Mine Test Little Pony

Change into a pony! Based off of the original Mine Little Pony At the moment, this mod is very barebones and is missing many important features. Furthermore you will find that the animations are jarring, and some of the textures have issues as well.

Disclaimer: This mod is NOT offically associated with the original Mine Little Pony mod, nor is it maintained by any of the original developers.

Given the nature of this mod, it is worth pointing out in good faith -- that all repurposed media is lisenced under MIT, or has been remade by hand -- the former being obtained by directly compiling and editing assets from the official Mine Little Pony repository ONLY. Furthermore The character skin editor is a reimplementation of Johannes Fritz's Edit Skin mod which has been modified very slighty.

Features: * custom skin_edit implementation (mane, tail, eye, and color customization) * Basic walking animation

Currently Missing: * Unicorns / Pegasi / Changelings / etc * Animations for anything but walking really
